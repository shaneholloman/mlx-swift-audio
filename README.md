# MLX Swift Audio

**This package is in early development. Expect breaking changes.**

## Installation

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/DePasqualeOrg/mlx-swift-audio.git", branch: "main")
```

## Usage

```swift
import MLXAudio

// Kokoro - 60+ voices, speed control
let kokoro = KokoroEngine()
try await kokoro.say("Hello, world!", voice: .afHeart)

// With speed adjustment
try await kokoro.say("Speaking faster", voice: .afNova, speed: 1.5)

// Orpheus - emotional expressions
let orpheus = OrpheusEngine()
try await orpheus.say("Ha! <laugh> That's funny.", voice: .tara)

// Marvis - streaming audio
let marvis = MarvisEngine()
try await marvis.load(voice: .conversationalA)
try await marvis.sayStreaming("This plays as it generates.")

// OuteTTS - custom voices with reference audio
let outetts = OuteTTSEngine()
let speaker = try OuteTTSEngine.loadSpeaker(from: "speaker.json")
try await outetts.say("Using reference audio.", speaker: speaker)
```

For more control over playback:

```swift
let audio = try await kokoro.generate("Hello!", voice: .afHeart)
await audio.play()
```

## Building

Build the library:

```sh
xcodebuild -scheme mlx-audio -destination 'platform=macOS' build
```

Build the example app:

```sh
xcodebuild -project 'examples/TTS App/TTS App.xcodeproj' -scheme 'TTS App' -destination 'platform=macOS' build
```

## Engines

- **Kokoro**: 60+ voices, 10+ languages, speed control
- **Orpheus**: Emotional expressions (`<laugh>`, `<sigh>`, etc.)
- **Marvis**: Streaming audio generation
- **OuteTTS**: Custom voices with reference audio
